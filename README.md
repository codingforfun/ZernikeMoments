# Note: 

This is basically just a copy from the source below. I don’t maintain the code. I also don’t use it myself. 
I had plans to use it in a project but then went other ways, so this is basically just a copy of the plain 
code for backup purposes and some CMake added, because that’s the build system I usually use. 

Please don’t ask me about how to do stuff with the code or errors. Please refer to the original source below 
or the papers in case of questions. 
Anyway it’s ok if you report issues for discussion with others, just note I can’t/won’t answer most questions 
and will probably do nothing to test/integrate/fix anything to the code. 
Feel free to fork again and maintain according to the original copyright notice below.
